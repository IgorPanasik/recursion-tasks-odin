ðŸ“ŒProject: Recursion (The Odin Project)
A JavaScript tutorial project aimed at mastering recursion by solving two classic problems:

- Fibonacci Sequence â€” the fibs(n) function generates the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, and fibsRec(n) solves the same problem recursively.

- Merge Sort â€” the mergeSort(array) function sorts an array of numbers using the merge sort algorithm (divide and conquer).

The project runs in the Node.js console and helps to consolidate the understanding of recursive algorithms with practical examples.
